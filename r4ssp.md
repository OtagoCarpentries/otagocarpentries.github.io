# R for Successful Student Projects

**As of 2022 this course is now being coordinated by Research and Teaching IT Support. For more information and for sign up please see [https://rtis-training.github.io/r4ssp](https://rtis-training.github.io/r4ssp)**


## Course description

Advances in scientific technologies from remote sensors to genetic sequencers mean scientists are now working with huge data sets, and must be expert in the computer tools that can analyse those data. Many undergraduate science papers now require students to process and analyse real data using special programming languages like R. In this mini-course, we will help you to learn exactly those parts of R that science students need for their in-course research assignments. Class sessions combine structured presentation of new material, and hands-on coding practice with support from experienced R programmers, scientists, and educators.





### Other ITS operated R courses

University of Otago ITS also offer free courses for students and staff for R. Descriptions and registration can be found at [https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/](https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/)

### Other places to learn more about R or get help

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a global organisation that provides workshops to teach computational skills for researchers. Periodically we run these workshops on campus. Check out [https://otagocarpentries.github.io/](https://otagocarpentries.github.io) for up-coming workshops run at Otago. The workshop content is also free and available to be worked through outside of the workshops. These are the R relevant workshops from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org):

- [Data Carpentry - Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
- [Data Carpentry - Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/)
- [Software Carpentry - Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation)
- [Software Carpentry - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder)

[R for Data Science online community](https://www.rfordatasci.com) is an online community created to help people learn R from the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham.
