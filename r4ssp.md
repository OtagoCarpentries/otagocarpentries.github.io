## R for Successful Student Projects


### Course description

R for successful student projects is a free, self-driven, mini course that will introduce participants to the R programming language for the purpose of data analysis. Interpretation of statistical analysis is outside of the scope of this course.

It is designed as a course that learners can work through in their own time and pace with a drop-in help session provided weekly from the 8th of March as an opportunity to access help with the content in-person.

There is no assessment or credit offered as part of this course.


### Course Resources

The course material is free of cost and is comprised of:
 - [Handouts and Exercises](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ttf1s8-vkJNOlHdphfi2zFyMq6gGEvCy?usp=sharing) (Currently in draft form but final versions will be up by the 8th March)
 - [The R for Data Science online book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (main reference text)
 - [Tabular data analysis with R and the Tidyverse](https://static-bcrf.biochem.wisc.edu/courses/Tabular-data-analysis-with-R-and-Tidyverse/book/)


Material can be worked through on either your own machine (R and RStudio will need to be installed) or on the [Virtual Student Desktop](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/studentit/student-desktop/)

### Drop-in help sessions

**What:** An opportunity to get help in-person on the course content and attendance is not required to participate in this course. To get the most out of these sessions bringing your own device with access to R/RStudio is strongly recommended.

**When:** Drop-in anytime on Mondays between 10 and 12 noon, starting from 8th March

**Where:** University of Otago Science Library Seminar Room (ground floor). The room fits 25 people (reduced to 12 under Alert Level 2), and will operate on a first come-first served basis.


If you are following along weekly, the proposed schedule is as follows:

Date | Module | Topic

15th March | 2 | Make friends with R and RStudio
22nd March | 3 | Data visualisation
29th March | 4 | Data handling
5th April | Mid Semester Break |
12th April | 5 | Exploratory and descriptive data analysis
19th April | 6 | Performing inferential tests (N.B this is _how_ to run statistical tests, not _why_ or _what they mean_)
26th April | ANZAC Observed |
3rd May | 7 | Modularity and Flow of Control 1
10th May | 8 | Modularity and Flow of Control 2


The drop-in session on Monday 8th will be delivered as a lesson, subsequent sessions will be in the form of facilitated group help.
