## R for Successful Student Projects


### Course description

R for successful student projects is a free, self-driven, mini course that will introduce participants to the R programming language for the purpose of data analysis. Interpretation of statistical analysis is outside of the scope of this course.

It is designed as a course that learners can work through in their own time and pace with a drop-in help session provided weekly from the 8th of March as an opportunity to access help with the content in-person.

There is no assessment or credit offered as part of this course.



### Course Resources

The course material is free of cost and is comprised of:
 - [Handouts and Exercises](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ttf1s8-vkJNOlHdphfi2zFyMq6gGEvCy?usp=sharing)
   * Modules 1 -4 Currently available
   * Modules 5 -8 will be released by mid-semester
 - [The R for Data Science online book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) (main reference text)
 - [Tabular data analysis with R and the Tidyverse](https://static-bcrf.biochem.wisc.edu/courses/Tabular-data-analysis-with-R-and-Tidyverse/book/)


Material can be worked through on either your own machine (R and RStudio will need to be installed) or on the [Virtual Student Desktop](https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/studentit/student-desktop/)

#### Feedback

It would be greatly appreciated if as you complete modules you fill in this three question survey [https://tinyurl.com/r4ssp-module-fb](https://tinyurl.com/r4ssp-module-fb) which will help further iterations of the course.

### Drop-in help sessions

**What:** An opportunity to get help in-person on the course content and attendance is not required to participate in this course. To get the most out of these sessions bringing your own device with access to R/RStudio is strongly recommended.

**When:** Drop-in anytime on Mondays between 10 and 12 noon, starting from 8th March

**Where:** University of Otago Science Library Seminar Room (ground floor). The room fits 25 people (reduced to 12 under Alert Level 2), and will operate on a first come-first served basis.


If you are following along weekly, the proposed schedule is as follows:

Date | Module | Topic | Readings
---|---|---|---
8th March | 1 | Start with tidy data (delivered as a lesson) | 
15th March | 2 | Make friends with R and RStudio | [R for Data Science - Chapter 1: Introduction] (https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html), [Chapter 4: Workflow basics](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html)
22nd March | 3 | Data visualisation | [R for Data Science - Chapter 3: Data visualisation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html)
29th March | 4 | Data handling | [R for Data Science - Chapter 5: Data transformation ](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html)
5th April | Mid Semester Break |
12th April | 5 | Exploratory and descriptive data analysis |
19th April | 6 | Performing inferential tests (N.B this is _how_ to run statistical tests, not _why_ or _what they mean_) |
26th April | ANZAC Observed | |
3rd May | 7 | Modularity and Flow of Control 1 |
10th May | 8 | Modularity and Flow of Control 2 |


The drop-in session on Monday 8th will be delivered as a lesson, subsequent sessions will be in the form of facilitated group help.

Modules can be completed at the learners own pace 
- Modules 1 - 4 released
- Modules 5 - 8 being released prior to mid-semester break.


### ITS operated R courses

University of Otago ITS also offer free courses for students and staff for R. Descriptions and registration can be found at [https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/](https://corpapp.otago.ac.nz/training/its/course/subject/research-tools/)

### Other places to learn more about R or get help


[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) is a global organisation that provides workshops to teach computational skills for researchers. Periodically we run these workshops on campus. Check out [https://otagocarpentries.github.io/](https://otagocarpentries.github.io) for up-coming workshops run at Otago. The workshop content is also free and available to be worked through outside of the workshops. These are the R relevant workshops from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org):
  * [Data Carpentry - Ecology](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/)
  * [Data Carpentry - Social Sciences](https://datacarpentry.org/r-socialsci/) 
  * [Software Carpentry - Programming with R](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation)
  * [Software Carpentry - R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder) 


[R for Data Science online community](https://www.rfordatasci.com) is an online community created to help people learn R from the [R for Data Science book](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham.
