## R for Successful Student Projects

R for successful student projects is a free, mini course that will introduce participants to the R programming language for the purpose of data analysis.

It is designed as a course that learners can work through in their own time and pace with a drop-in help session provided weekly from the 8th of March to provide an opportunity to access in-person help with the content.

### Drop-in help sessions

**When:** Mondays 10 - 12 noon, starting from 8th March

**Where:** University of Otago Science Library Seminar Room (ground floor). The room fits 25 people (reduced to 12 under Alert Level 2), and will operate on a first come-first served basis



If you are following along weekly the proposed schedule is as follows:

Date | Module | Topic
---|---|---
8th March | 1 | Start with tidy data
15th March | 2 | Make friends with R and RStudio
22nd March | 3 | Data visualisatoin
